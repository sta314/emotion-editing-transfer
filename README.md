# Facial Emotion Editing and Transfer with StyleGAN
### CS585 Deep Generative Networks Project

This project is about facial emotion editing and transfer by utilizing generative networks, namely StyleGAN2. GAN inversion here is done by pSp and HyperStyle. Instead of an injection-based technique, we tried an editing approach for the transfer task and obtained fairly good results. Detailed information is not available. However, you can read our report for further understanding.
